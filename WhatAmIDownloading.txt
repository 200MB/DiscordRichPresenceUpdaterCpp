1)easyrp is an amazing exe file which'll upload the updated information into discord here's a  link (https://github.com/Pizzabelly/EasyRP)

2)config.ini this is the file that'll communicate with easyrp

3)backup.txt is a file that'll be used by the cpp code for two main reasons (1.avoid crashes   2.edit the config.ini file safely) 

if you somehow managed to mess the config file up (don't worry) just copy everything from backup and paste it in

4)code itself. edits the backup.txt and updates the changed info in config.ini
