# DiscordRichPresenceUpdaterCpp
discord state/details updater.it just takes your inputted words and automatically updates it instead of you manually doing it.

the instructions are pretty straight forward (written in a code).

i will also add image updaters (both large and small)

if you encounter a bug (report).

oh also don't edit the backup file unless you know what you're doing.some changes might crash the whole code.
